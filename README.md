---README---

This is not my first personal project in web development, but it is my first project through The Odin Project.

Location is Web Development 101 -> The Front End -> Project: HTML/CSS

This project was mostly a review in basic HTML and CSS.

The only real novelty was putting it on Github, which I'm still in the process of doing at the time of writing.

Tomorrow I'll put up the HTML and look into a good way to check for compiling from Github.
