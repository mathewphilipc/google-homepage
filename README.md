---README---

This is not my first personal project in web development, but it is my first project through The Odin Project.

Location is Web Development 101 -> The Front End -> Project: HTML/CSS

This project was mostly a review in basic HTML and CSS. The only real novelty was putting it on Github.

I've gotten what I wanted to get out of this project, so as of 19 Feb 2017 I'm leaving it alone indefinitely.
